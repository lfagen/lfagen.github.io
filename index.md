## about ##
I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are in semantics, pragmatics, and psycholinguistics. Lately I've been working on the semantics of exclusive modifiers.

I'm a member of the [Language Processing Lab](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/) and the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://uchicagocompling.github.io/).
