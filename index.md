## about ##
I'm a 4th-year PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are in semantics, pragmatics, and psycholinguistics. I'm a member of the [Language Processing Lab](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/) and the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://uchicagocompling.github.io/). 

Here's my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W3f-kgsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile.
